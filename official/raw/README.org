Important observations

In order to make parsing easier, we defined some markers and
conventions. Take this part of the raw file as an example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
---
ENUM [NULL]? Quest√£o [num] 

AREA [area]

[text]
 
OPTIONS

A) [text]

B) [text]

C) [text]

D:CORRECT) [text]
#+END_EXAMPLE

- The CORRECT indicates the correct answer.

- In every exam there are 4 different models of test. Each model has
  the same content, however, the questions are presented in a
  different sequential order. That's specially important when you
  check the answer sheet. For this corpus we only used the white model
  or the first model of the exam (named in portuguese as "prova
  branca").

- The marker bellow was used to indicate that this question was
  nullified by the organizers:

- On the first, second and third exams the whole test used to have 100
  questions. From the 4th exam onwards the organizers changed the test
  to have a total of 80 questions.

- Before 2010, Brazil did not have a unified OAB Exam. Each State from
  the country used to have his own exam.

- For some reason, the 6th and the 20th exams had problems and they
  were reapplied in some regions of the country. Both the first and
  the reapplication count as the 6th edition. However, these two tests
  had a different content.

- We inserted the areas of law as a marker. This is the complete list
  of all the areas covered on the exams:

  - ETHICS
  - PHILOSOPHY
  - CONSTITUTIONAL
  - HUMAN-RIGHTS
  - INTERNATIONAL
  - TAXES
  - ADMINISTRATIVE
  - ENVIRONMENTAL
  - CIVIL
  - CHILDREN
  - CONSUMER
  - BUSINESS
  - CIVIL-PROCEDURE
  - CRIMINAL
  - CRIMINAL-PROCEDURE
  - LABOUR
  - LABOUR-PROCEDURE
