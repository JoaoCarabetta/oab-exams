This experiment does not depend on Elastic Search to make it easier to
run in clusters.

You need to dump your Elastic Search indices and generate oab.json and
corpus.json via dump.py

$ python3 dump.py
$ mv corpus.tmp.json corpus.json
$ mv oab.tmp.json oab.json

If you have a new oab.json file, first run split-oab.py to split it
into independent JSONs one of each question and put these new JSONs in
the questions/ directory.

To execute, run:

for f in questions/*.json; do python3 pmi-solver.py $f; done

If you are using LSF, you can run the jobs in parallel like:

for f in questions/*.json; do bsub python3 pmi-solver.py $f; done

After the PMI calculation is done, move all the pmi*.json to a separate
directory (say, pmi/) and generate the report as follows:

python3 report.py questions-pmi/*.json | sort | uniq -c
