If you have a new oab.json file, first run split-oab.py to split it
into independent JSONs one of each question and put these new JSONs in
the questions/ directory.

To execute, run:

for questions/*.json; do python3 pmi.py $f; done

If you are using LSF, you can run the jobs in parallel like:

for f in questions/*.json; do bsub python3 pmi.py $f; done

After the PMI calcuation is done, move all the pmi*.json to a separate
directory (say, pmi/) and generate the report as follows:

To generate the report, run:

python3 report.py questions-pmi/*.json | sort | uniq -c
